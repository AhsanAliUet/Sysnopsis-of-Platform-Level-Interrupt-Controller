\chapter{Project Overview and Objectives}
\label{Chapter4}

Discuss the overview/goal of the project and outline the proposed solution. Give your valued proposition. How is your solution going to be different and better than others? Students must describe the final project output in detail, its expected packaging, and hardware/software components. In case of a research problem, how the proposed research solution is expected to be better than the state-of-the-art? Write three to four bullet points to clearly define the objectives of your project. ($1-2$ pages)
